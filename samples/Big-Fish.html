<p>There are some fish that cannot be caught.  It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.  They're just touched by something extra.  Call it luck.  Call it grace.  One such fish was The Beast.  </p>
</div>

<p>EDWARD (V.O.)(CONT'D)
By the time I was born, he was already a legend.  He'd taken more hundred-dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. Some said that fish was the ghost of Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned in that river 60 years before.   Others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, left over from the Cretaceous period.</p>

<p>I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.  All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish since I was a boy no bigger than you.   (closer) And on the day you were born, that was the day I finally caught him.</p>

<p>Now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.  Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.</p>

<p>Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave.  And then another.  His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, wondering what's wrong.  Embarrassed, Edward just keeps SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.</p>

<div class="element-action">
<p>He pulls at his collar.  Then pulls again, his face getting red.  Starting to panic, he loosens his tie.  He's starting to undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself.  Two more buttons fly off.  One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.</p>

<p>My muscles couldn't keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn't keep up with my body's ambition.  So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the World Book Encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.  I had made it all the way to the "G's," hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.</p>

<p>You don't like it?</p>

<div class="element-action">
<p>She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence.  Edward is breathless.  It's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away.</p>
</div>

<div class="element-action">
<p>Then he sees the snake.</p>
</div>

<div class="element-action">
<p>It's a cottonmouth, has to be.  It leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.  There's no decision to be made.  On pure instinct, Edward dives in.  He swims as hard as can, </p>

<div class="element-action">
<p>Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles.  He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches.  He swings off, lands and rolls.  Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.</p>

<p>Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.   (beat, gathering) Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die."  I was so scared I woke up my parents.  They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed.  But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.</p>

<p>Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.  Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die."  Well, I ran right back to my parents.  My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation.  And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead. </p>

<div class="element-action">
<p>He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.</p>

<p>EDWARD </p>
<p>For the next couple weeks, I didn't have another dream.  Until one night the crow came back and said, "Your Daddy is going to die."   (beat) Well, I didn't know what to do.  But finally I told my father.  And he said not to worry, but I could tell he was rattled.  That next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.  Because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words:  your Daddy is going to die.  Well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time.  And when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day.  He said to my mother, "Good God.  I just had the worst day of my life." (beat) "You think _you've_ had a bad day," she said.  "This morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!"</p>

Your mother came in about three in the afternoon.  Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita.  You were born a week early, but there were no complications.  It was a perfect delivery.  Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there.  And that's the real story of how you were born.</p>

<p>After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups.  By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling stories.  They're telling Edward's stories.</p>

<p>We find Will watching them.</p>
