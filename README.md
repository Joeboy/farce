# Farce - a Fountain Parser

## This is an unfinished work in progress! Don't expect too much from it!

### What does it do?

It parses the [Fountain Screenplay Format](https://fountain.io/), and generates a PDF in something approximating the [standard screenplay format](https://www.nfi.edu/screenplay-format/). It doesn't implement the full spec, and definitely has some bugs and omissions. But it seems to kinda mostly work, to the small extent I've tested it so far. If you'd like anything implemented of fixed please raise an issue.

This was partly a learning project, and it's the first proper thing I've done in Rust, so if you're a real rust dev feel free to educate me about all the things I'm doing wrong.
